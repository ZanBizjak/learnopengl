# LearnOpenGL tutorial
In this repository I will track my own progress in learning openGL via the [LearnOpenGL website](https://learnopengl.com)

## Structure of the repo
The direcotry structure will mirror the site's tutorial structure. Each directory will be a c project of it's own where the final result will be that tutorial's page goal. 

With this structure I will be able to clearly see what has been added to with each step of the tutorial (1st being just an open window, 2nd a trangle in that window, etc). By structuring my tutorial in such a way, I will have a clearer insight into what exactly has been done in each step by comparing it to the pervious/next one
